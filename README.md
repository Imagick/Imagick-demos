## Imagick-demos

An example of all the Imagick functions. Or at least most of them. The site is hosted at http://phpimagick.com/

The site uses Docker. If you have that on your system, you should be able to run the site locally with:

```
sh runLocal.sh
```

It will take a few minutes (or more) to come up, as it has to compile ImageMagick 6 and 7, and then Imagick. After the first run, these are cached, so should only take a few seconds.

## PHPStorm stub file

TODO - move the instructions to the Imagick extension...
