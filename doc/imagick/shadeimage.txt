Shines a distant light on an image to create a three-dimensional effect.
   You control the positioning of the light with azimuth and elevation;
   azimuth is measured in degrees off the x axis and elevation is measured
   in pixels above the Z axis.
   This method is available if Imagick has been compiled against ImageMagick version 6.2.9 or newer.
