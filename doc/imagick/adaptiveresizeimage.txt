Adaptively resize image with data-dependent triangulation. Avoids
   blurring across sharp color changes. Most useful when used to shrink
   images slightly to a slightly smaller "web size"; may not look good
   when a full-sized image is adaptively resized to a thumbnail.
   This method is available if Imagick has been compiled against ImageMagick version 6.2.9 or newer.
