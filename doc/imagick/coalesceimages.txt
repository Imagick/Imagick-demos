Composites a set of images while respecting any page offsets
   and disposal methods.  GIF, MIFF, and MNG animation sequences
   typically start with an image background and each subsequent
   image varies in size and offset.  Returns a new Imagick object
   where each image in the sequence is the same size as the first
   and composited with the next image in the sequence.
