Draws a cubic Bezier curve from the current point to (x,y) using relative
   coordinates. The first control point is assumed to be the reflection of
   the second control point on the previous command relative to the current
   point. (If there is no previous command or if the previous command was not
   an DrawPathCurveToAbsolute, DrawPathCurveToRelative, 
   DrawPathCurveToSmoothAbsolute or DrawPathCurveToSmoothRelative, assume the
   first control point is coincident with the current point.) (x2,y2) is the
   second control point (i.e., the control point at the end of the curve). At
   the end of the command, the new current point becomes the final (x,y)
   coordinate pair used in the polybezier.
