Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to (x, y) using absolute
   coordinates. The size and orientation of the ellipse are defined by two
   radii (rx, ry) and an xAxisRotation, which indicates how the ellipse as
   a whole is rotated relative to the current coordinate system. The center
   (cx, cy) of the ellipse is calculated automatically to satisfy the
   constraints imposed by the other parameters. largeArcFlag and sweepFlag
   contribute to the automatic calculations and help determine how the arc
   is drawn. If large_arc_flag is True; then draw the larger of the available
   arcs. If sweep_flag is true, then draw the arc matching a clock-wise
   rotation.
