Specifies the miter limit. When two line segments meet at a sharp angle
   and miter joins have been specified for 'lineJoin', it is possible for
   the miter to extend far beyond the thickness of the line stroking the 
   path. The miterLimit' imposes a limit on the ratio of the miter length to
   the 'lineWidth'.
