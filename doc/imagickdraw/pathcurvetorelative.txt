Draws a cubic Bezier curve from the current point to (x,y) using (x1,y1)
   as the control point at the beginning of the curve and (x2,y2) as the
   control point at the end of the curve using relative coordinates. At the
   end of the command, the new current point becomes the final (x,y) 
   coordinate pair used in the polybezier.
