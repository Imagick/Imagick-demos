Clones the current ImagickDraw to create a new ImagickDraw, which is then
   added to the ImagickDraw stack. The original drawing ImagickDraw(s) may be
   returned to by invoking ImagickDraw::pop. The ImagickDraws are stored on a
   ImagickDraw stack. For every Pop there must have already been an equivalent
   Push.
