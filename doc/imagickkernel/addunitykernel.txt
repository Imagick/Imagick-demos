Adds a given amount of the 'Unity' Convolution Kernel to the given pre-scaled
   and normalized Kernel. This in effect adds that amount of the original image
   into the resulting convolution kernel. The resulting effect is to convert the
   defined kernels into blended soft-blurs, unsharp kernels or into sharpening kernels.
